Crystallization Condition Prediction

This project is an incomplete attempt to predict x-ray crystallography crystallization conditions from a protein's amino acid sequence.  The first arm of this project involves downloading and processing the crystallization condition data and the protein structure data.  The second arm involves failed attempts to predict crystallization information from the 3D point or voxel encoding of the protein.
