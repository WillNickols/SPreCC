## Overview

Knowledge of the three-dimensional structures of proteins is essential for understanding their biological functions and developing targeted molecular therapies.  The most common technique for elucidating the structure of a protein is X-ray crystallography, but obtaining high quality crystals for X-ray diffraction remains the bottleneck of this technique.  Predicting chemical conditions that would produce high quality crystals from the amino acid sequence of a protein would considerably speed this process.  Previous efforts have attempted to determine the optimal pH for crystallization from a protein's amino acid sequence and its pI or predict a list of chemical conditions for crystallization from its amino acid sequence.  However, to our knowledge, no attempt has been made to predict the technique, pH, temperature, chemical conditions, and concentrations of those chemical conditions all together from a protein's amino acid sequence.  Here, we present and evaluate SPreCC, a method of predicting categorical, continuous, and presence/absence information for crystalliation conditions based on amino acid sequence similarity.
